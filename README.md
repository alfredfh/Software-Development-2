# Skywars

## Objective
The game designed required was a moved-based game with a GUI using JAVA. It demonstrates OOP principles just as polymorphism and the use of interfaces. The GUI was updated as the game progressed and adhered to the separation of concerns by keeping the game logic separate from the user interface. Furthermore, JUnit testing was conducted ensuring code reliability and performance. Additonal advanced features included saving and loading game progress, implementing a design pattern such as the Observer pattern, and allowing the game's master ship to toggle between offensive and defensive modes.

### Skills Learned

-  Developed Skywars game in Java, focusing on OOP principles.
-  GUI development in Java
-  Polymorphism and interfaces
-  Unit testing with JUnit
-  Serialization and file handling
-  Design patterns (Observer pattern)
-  Problem solving to develop the game logic and event-driven programming

### Tools Used
